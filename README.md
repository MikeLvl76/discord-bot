# Purpose 

Experiment discord module from Node.js and see its features. Creating your own bot allows you to choose whatever you want for options and can be a huge help for managing servers with large amount of people. It is simple to add to your server with [Discord Developper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) that provides advices for bot installation.

# Current version

Since it's the beginning of the project, there is almost no interaction with the bot.

Few commmands created :
- ping : use `/ping` for an answer from the bot
- info : 
    - use `/info server` to see info from the server where the bot is
    - use `/info user` + username to see info for the choosen user
- gif : use `/gif` + word for bot replying with a gif relying to the given word


Few interactions :
- "quoi" : the bot will answer with "feur" (french joke : quoi and feur together sounds like "coiffeur")
- "oui" : the bot will answer with "stiti" (also french joke)
- Each minute the bot will post a message
- One time per day the bot will post a message
